# World_Weather_Analysis
Repository for world weather data analysis using python code

## Overview of World Weather data Analysis
Jack, the head of data analysis in the user interface group of a travel technology company needs help to collect and present relevant information to users searching for hotel/lodging through the PlanMyTrip travel website. The results data should also incorporate the weather data for the relevant cities so that the users can plan their travel based on the weather forecast. This would enable end users to plan their vacations more efficiently.  

Jack needs help to provide real-time suggestions for the end user's ideal hotels. A hotel could be termed as "ideal" for a client based on the following:

- The hotel(s) are within a given range of latitude and longitude
- The location of the hotels(s) have the right kind of weather based on the client preference

## Resources
**Data Source:** WeatherPy_Database.csv , WeatherPy_vacation.csv
**Software:** Python 3.8, Visual Studio Code 1.59, Matplotlib, Google APIs for weather and directions


## Additional work areas that extends the usability of this project
The following exercises will increase the usability of the application:
 - Creating visualizations that showcase the weather parameters retrieved with changing latitude for the 500-plus cities from all over the world. This plot can be used to explore how weather parameters change based on latitude. 
- The visualizations can also be used to study climate change over a period of time
- The exercises done can be used to add a feature on any application that allows customers to search for locations they want to travel based on their temperature preferences
- In addition to hotel locations the direction exercise can be used to incorporate driving/walking or bicycling directions from one or more preferred locations
